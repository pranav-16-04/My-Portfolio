<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
     Hello! I'm Penugonda Giri Pranav, a second-year student pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science
     and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and
     Machine Learning at Vellore Institute of Technology, Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh.
</p>

<p>
     I've always been fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology brings to the table,
     and my journey in the world of tech has been nothing short of exhilarating so far.
     Currently, I'm deeply immersed in exploring the realms of web development, honing my skills to craft meaningful
     and interactive experiences on the web.

<p>  
     Beyond the confines of my academic curriculum, my passion lies in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
     The idea of creating intelligent systems that can perceive, learn, and make decisions akin to human 
     cognition never fails to intrigue me. I'm constantly seeking ways to delve deeper into AI, whether 
     it's through self-study, research, or engaging in projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.
</p>
<p>
     I believe that every challenge is an opportunity for growth,
     and I'm excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in my journey as a student,
     a tech enthusiast, and a future innovator in the field of AI.
